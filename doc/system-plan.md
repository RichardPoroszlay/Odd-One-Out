## Project plan

The first and most important issue is to clarify responsibilites to our project.

In our project there are two roles: Scrum master and Developer.

### What does a Scrum master do?

Scrum master: A Scrum Master is a professional who leads a team using Agile project management through the course of a project. A Scrum Master facilitates all the communication and collaboration between leadership and team players to ensure a successful outcome.

### What does a Developer do?

Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional.
