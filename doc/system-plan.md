## Purpose of the system

Introduction:
The purpose of the Odd-One-Out game is to create an interactive and entertaining Python-based application that challenges players' observation and analytical skills. The game is designed to present a series of words to the player, with the objective of identifying the item that does not belong to the group based on a predefined rule or pattern.

Game Objective:
The primary goal of the Odd-One-Out game is to engage players in a fun and intellectually stimulating activity.
Within each set, there will be one item that does not conform to the underlying rule or pattern, making it the "odd one out." Players must identify and select this item to advance to the next level or earn points.

Key Features:
- User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) will be provided to enhance the overall gaming experience.
- Varied Content: The game will support multiple modes, ensuring a diverse and engaging experience for players.

Target Audience:
The Odd-One-Out game is designed for individuals of all ages who enjoy puzzle-solving and cognitive challenges. It can be a valuable educational tool for enhancing logical reasoning and pattern recognition skills in children and adults alike.

Conclusion:
The Odd-One-Out game aims to provide an engaging and intellectually stimulating gaming experience, fostering cognitive skills and logical reasoning in players. By offering varied content, it seeks to entertain and educate players of all ages.
