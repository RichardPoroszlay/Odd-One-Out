## Overview
In this project, we implement an Odd One Out videogame.
The project's backend is made in Python with the Flask micro web framework, and for the frontend we use HTML and CSS.

The game contains multiple game modes, so the player can choose their favourite ones in the GUI.
After the player has chosen their game mode, their purpose is to find the inappropriate word in the word set.
The purpose of each game mode is different. (see Functional Specification)

## Current state
The first and most important purpose of our application is entertainment and spending valuable time. The Odd One Out games are intuitive and
challenging. As scientific publications state, the game helps young children to improve the way of their thinking.
The game is also good for ability testing such as linguistic and analytic skills measuring.

## Developers purpose
Our purpose is to create an open source, free application which helps the education of the young generation.
We also want the game to be available in digital format.

We are planning to create four game modes:
- Base game
- Time race
- Input based
- Hardcore

## Functional requirements
In the main menu we can choose between different game modes.
In each game mode the player choose between given words with their mice in the GUI window.

## System License
It's an open source project, no licence is used.

## Legal requirements that apply to the system
Copyright and Intellectual Property:
- Ensure that the game's content, including graphics, sound, and text, does not infringe upon the copyrights or intellectual property rights of others.
- If you use any third-party assets or open-source libraries, be sure to adhere to their licensing terms and give proper attribution when required.
  
Accessibility:
- Ensure that your game is accessible to players with disabilities by adhering to accessibility guidelines and laws
  
Trademarks and Branding:
- Be cautious about using trademarks, logos, or branding elements of other companies or products without proper authorization, as this can lead to legal issues.
  
Contractual Agreements:
- If you work with collaborators, artists, or developers, create clear contracts outlining ownership, royalties, and other rights and responsibilities to prevent disputes down the line.

Fair Competition:
- Avoid unfair competition practices, such as false advertising, that could lead to legal action from competitors.

## Why would I use this project?
Nowadays the young generation have access to digital devices, thus our objective is to have this game available also digitally, not only as a card game.

This provides more flexibility.

## Applied business processes
In contrast to accessable websites, our application requires no registration.
We don't keep any of your data, so you can play safely with our game.
