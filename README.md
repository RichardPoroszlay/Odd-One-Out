# Odd One Out

## Overview
In this project, we implement an Odd One Out videogame.
The project's backend is made in Python with the Flask micro web framework, and for the frontend we use HTML and CSS.

The game contains multiple gamemodes, so the player can choose their favourite ones in the GUI.
After the player has chosen their gamemode, their purpose is to find the inappropriate word in the word set.
The purpose of each gamemode is different. (see Functional Specification)

## Current state
The first and most important purpose of our application is entertainment and spending valuable time. The Odd One Out games are intuitive and
challenging. As scientific publications state, the game helps young children to improve the way of their thinking.
The game is also good for ability testing such as linguistic and analytic skills measuring.
